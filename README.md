Toad's Train is a survival game where you will try to reach further distances inside a train while fighting toads.
Toads will try to fight you and your train. And your train will be on fire if you don't kick parts some time.
Unlock upgrades on the garage to go even further!

Inspired by classic browser games where you play many times to get further while unlocking new upgrades. The train events try to give a sense of urgency to the player, while the toads keep the pressure on the combat side. Upgrades are there to improve replayability. Working with Godot 4.1.

<h2 id="#game-development"> Game development</h2>
Code uses a lot of the Observer Pattern, also composition and finite state machines. It tries to keep features in unique components, like Health, Attack, and then reuse them in multiple different game units. It's worth saying that it was created in just 7 days.
